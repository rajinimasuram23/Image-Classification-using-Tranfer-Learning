# Image-Classification-using-Tranfer-Learning
The objective of this project is to identify and portray the features occurring in an image in terms of the object as a unique gray level and classify any given image by applying the transfer learning technique. In this project, Pytorch, a library developed for Python, specializing in deep learning and natural language processing is used.
